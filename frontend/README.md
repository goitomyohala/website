# Frontend Application

Static frontend files for the website.

## Files

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `styles.css` - All styles
- `script.js` - Frontend JavaScript with API integration

## Development

The frontend is served by the backend server. No build process required - just edit the files and refresh the browser.

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API at `/api/*` endpoints.
